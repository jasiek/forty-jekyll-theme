description: Come join us a for a chat and a pint!
---

To celebrate the milestone of reaching *four hundred users* on our [Slack channel](http://signup.openbanking.space/), we've decided to run a [meetup in London](https://www.meetup.com/open-banking-it-IS-about-the-tech/events/250063794/).
This will be very different from many panels which you may have attended in the past, as we will be discussing primarily technology which enables open banking, rather than anything related to vision or strategy.

The meetup will take place at Monzo's headquarters in London on May 21st, 2018. We will be hosting a panel debate on technology which enables open banking. Speakers include:

* [Chris Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjemichael/) from [Ozone Bank](https://o3bank.com/).
* [Ralph Bragg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralphbragg/) from [RAiDIAM](https://www.raidiam.com/).
* [Stevie Graham](https://twitter.com/stevegraham/) from [Teller](https://teller.io).
* [Simon Vans-Colina](http://simon.vc/) from [Monzo](https://monzo.com/).

We hope to see you in London on the 21st!
